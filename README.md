# QUIZ MASTER APP
The project I am working on focuses on developing an interactive quiz app designed to facilitate collaboration and evaluation between students and teachers or institutions. This app enables institutions to create and assign chapter-based quizzes, allowing students to attempt them regularly. Students can track their performance, while institutions can monitor their progress and assess their understanding of various subjects and topics, ensuring a more structured and effective learning experience
